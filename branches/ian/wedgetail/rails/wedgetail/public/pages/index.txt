Wedgetail is a means of storing medical information on the web.

It allows patients to access a summary of their own medical conditions. This information is placed in Wedgetail by their doctor or other health providers.

Wedgetail also enables this information to be shared by all doctors, hospitals and other health providers involved in a patient's care.
