<h2>Information for patients about Wedgetail</h2>

<h4>What is Wedgetail? </h4>

Wedgetail is an Individual Electronic Health Record Service which securely stores and shares important information about your health, such as the medications you take, any allergies you have and a summary of your health history. Your Individual Electronic Health Record does not replace your medical records held by your GP, your hospital records or any other records held by other health care providers. It contains a summary of all the important health information held in those other records. It also contains information that is collected when you visit participating health care providers such as GPs, specialists, nurses, and allied health professionals such as physiotherapists, dieticians and diabetic educators. 

<h4>How will Wedgetail help me? </h4>

When you visit different health care providers, the authorised health professional treating you can quickly and securely check your health information online rather than you having to rely on your memory. Wedgetail eliminates the need for paper records to be mailed or faxed and multiple telephone calls between health providers. Your medical information is stored in a safe repository and can be accessed quickly and easily by yourself and health professionals 24 hours a day. What information will be in Wedgetail? Each time you make a visit to a participating health care provider, a summary of the information collected about your treatment and care can be added to Wedgetail.
