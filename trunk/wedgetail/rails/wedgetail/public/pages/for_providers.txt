<h2>Information for Health Professionals</h2>

<h4>Consent to participate</h4>
Personal consent for information to be sent and viewed in Wedgetail is 
ongoing. At the time of agreeing to participate in Wedgetail, patients 
consent to an initial health summary being sent to their Individual 
Electronic Health Record by their nominated health care provider who 
is registered with Wedgetail. The health summary may be updated 
periodically. 

Patients decide which health care providers can access Wedgetail. 
Guest cards may be created by patients to allow health care providers 
a one-time access to their Individual Electronic Health Record. The 
patient may withdraw consent at any time or decide that information 
about a particular episode of care will not be included in Wedgetail. 

<h4>Transmission of information </h4>
Wedgetail uses HeSA's PKI and SSL encryption for the secure transfer 
of health information to ensure the highest standards in safety and 
privacy. Health data is sent to and retrieved from Wedgetail using 
International Standard HL7 messaging. 

<h4>Health professionals’ access</h4>
Health professionals can apply for access to Wedgetail by contacting 
the Wedgetail Project Officer via email at:  
wedgetail_admin@nrgpn.org.au. Once approved, a user name and 
password is nominated by the applicant and Wedgetail can be 
accessed through a web page on the internet. 

<h4>Health information</h4>
The health information in Wedgetail is flexible and may include all or 
some of the following: health summaries; medications; allergies; public 
hospital discharge summaries; public hospital encounters; primary care 
consultation summaries; letters; radiology and pathology reports; 
patient notes; care plans; team care arrangements and relevant 
templates.  

The message facility allows providers to send messages to other 
members of the health care team involved in caring for the 
individual. Health care providers may register an interest in 
receiving messages concerning an individual, thus having instant 
access to the most current information. Messages may also be sent 
directly to patients.  

<h4>Continuum of Care </h4>
Wedgetail is designed to provide health professionals with 
immediate access to health information across the continuum of care.  
Health care providers who may access information in Wedgetail 
include GPs, specialists, pharmacists, hospital staff, community health 
staff and allied health professionals.
  
<h4>Cost </h4>
There are no initial or ongoing costs to either the individual or the 
health professional to participate in Wedgetail. There may, 
however, be infrastructure costs for computers and internet services if 
these are not already in the clinical environment. 

<h4>Automation </h4>
The technical design of Wedgetail has been underscored by the 
desire for a user-friendly interface for ease of use by health 
professionals. Information from a primary source may be uploaded 
into Wedgetail with a few clicks of a mouse. Clinical data may be 
directly entered into a patient’s Shared Electronic Health Record at 
time of consultation, or may be uploaded at the end of a clinical 
consultation or verification of a medical report. Individual health 
summaries may be updated as regularly as the health care provider 
deems relevant. The scratchpad facility may be used for notes and 
social or familial information.  

Wedgetail saves time, enables immediate access to important 
medical information at the point of care, and assists in the 
integration and coordination of care.
